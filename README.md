# ðŸŽ“ Microservices Education Platform

A microservices-based backend system built with Spring Boot, Docker, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL to manage courses, users, notifications, and questions.

## ðŸ§± Services Overview

| Service         | Description                                  | Port  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| `user-service`  | Manages user registration, login, and roles  | 8080   |
| `course-service`| Handles course creation and enrollment       | 8081   |
| `notification-service` | Sends email/SMS notifications         | 8083   |
| `question-service` | Manages questions and assessments         | 8084   |

Each service runs independently and communicates via REST APIs.

###  Design Patterns in CourseService
The CourseService microservice leverages two fundamental design patterns to enhance scalability, maintainability, and flexibility:

Factory Pattern: Facilitates the creation of different course types based on input parameters.

Strategy Pattern: Enables the encapsulation and interchangeability of algorithms or behaviors, particularly for course-specific operations.

### Factory Pattern
Purpose: The Factory Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. It delegates the instantiation logic to a factory class, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.

Implementation in CourseService:

CourseFactory: This class contains the logic to instantiate different subclasses of the Course base class (ProgrammingCourse, LanguageCourse, BusinessCourse) based on the type provided in the request. 

###  Strategy Pattern

Strategy Pattern â€“ Conditional Enrollment Logic

Use Case in CourseService:
For Programming Courses, students with a GPA greater than 3.5 are not allowed to enroll. This rule is encapsulated using the Strategy pattern.

###  Why This Matters
Using the Strategy pattern for enrollment rules:

Keeps business logic isolated from controller/service layers

Makes it easy to add new rules (e.g., language level checks, business domain validation)

Avoids large if-else chains

Supports unit testing each rule independently
### uture Example Strategies
LanguageCourseEnrollmentStrategy: Prevent beginner-level students from taking advanced courses.

BusinessCourseEnrollmentStrategy: Require previous experience or course completion.
